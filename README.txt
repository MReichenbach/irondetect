This package contains the IronDetect correlation engine. Based on contexts,
signatures and anomalies, it detects deviations from normal behavior.
It presents correlations between IF-MAP metadata of different devices.
By the definition of rules in a policy by a security expert, the correlated
results can be used to analyze a network.
